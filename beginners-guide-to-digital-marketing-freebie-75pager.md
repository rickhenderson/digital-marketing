You’re on the way to big things.

This DONE-FOR-YOU beginners guide (with resell rights) is designed not just as a learning resource, but also a means for potential earnings.

With myriad high-ticket courses available, the goal here is to provide a more affordable and comprehensive guide, making the process of starting a digital product venture accommodating and accessible.

It's exciting to see you take this step into entrepreneurship. Remember, the sky's the limit! Let's embark on this journey and explore success together!

By following these steps inside, you will not only come out the other side with a digital product ready to sell, but you will also have a funnel and a solid sales strategy to start making money online!

## Chapter 1: WHAT ARE RESELL RIGHTS?

### WHAT ARE RESELL RIGHTS?

Starting a digital product business can be daunting, so I decided that I wanted to help people overcome one of the biggest hurdles - creating a digital product from scratch.

I wanted to offer them a digital product template that took out the stress of creating one, yet still provided a lot of value.

I wanted to offer them a digital product that would always be in high-demand.

Let’ s face it, with the world going digital, and the cost of living rising, it’ s no wonder more and more people are looking for ways to make extra income online! Gone are the days you need a university degree or special skills to start a business, and with  resell rights, you DEFINITELY don ’t need anything out of the ordinary!

In purchasing a DONE-FOR-YOU digital product with Private Label Rights, you get the rights to claim authorship of the product, to rebrand and modify it, and to resell it earning 100% profit for each and every sale!

What you will find with this Playbook is that not only did you purchase the Playbook itself, but you were also granted the Private Label Rights.

**These Private Label Rights were outlined in the Terms & Conditions you agreed to at checkout.**

### WHAT ARE RESELL RIGHTS?
 
**PLEASE NOTE**: If you wish to resell your e-book WITH resell rights to your own customers, you must adhere to the following terms:

* Change the NAME of the e-book (this is recommended whether or not you wish to resell this playbook with resell rights)
* Modify the branding of the e-book to make it your own 

Here is the template link if you would like to make this book your own: [https://www.canva.com/design/DAGSJop8ihk/REa_V48An1l4TWTiDbwWKw/edit?utm_content=DAGSJop8ihk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton](Get it on Canva)

## Chapter 2: CRAFTING YOUR VISION

### IDENTIFY YOUR WHY

 Believe me when I say, you SHOULD NOT skip this process.
Knowing your WHY is what will keep you committed
 to the process.
Starting a business can throw some people
 completely outside of their comfort zone, and
 sometimes things may get hard.
Knowing your reasons as to WHY you started in the
 first place, is crucial to the longevity of your
 business.
So before you dive in, pull out a pen and paper and
 answer these 3 questions:
 01 Why is it so important that I start this
 business?
 02 6 months from now, where do I want to
 be financially? what does that LOOK and
 FEEL like?
 03 How is this business going to change my
 life? What will I and my loved ones gain
 from this?
 *Once you have your answers and are
 CLEAR on them, then you’re ready to
 move on to your GOALS.

STEP 1: SELECTING A
 PRODUCT OR COURSE
 There are two things you need before we finish this
 stage in the playbook:
 A decision on the price for your digital product
 A solid idea on your income goals for your FIRST year
 after launching your business.
 Your Pricing Goals
 First, I want to advise you that there’s no “one right
 price”! However, when first starting out, it’s a good idea
 to have a lower ticket product priced between
 $30-$100.
You can always increase this price as your expertise and
 audience grow, but just to get your feet wet, starting off
 at this price is a great start!
 Your Income Goals
 Think about the monthly income you’d like to be
 bringing in at the 12 month mark in starting your
 business.
 To make it simple with the math breakdown, let’s say
 your goal is $100k/year.
1
Now, take that number and divide it into four quarters
 like this:
 1st quarter: $10k
 2nd quarter: $20k
 3rd quarter: $30k
 4th quarter: $40k
 Do you see how with each quarter, it progressively
 increases? This is because this is what businesses
 generally experience! They start bringing in a smaller
 amount, and with consistency, time & effort - it
 compounds!
 Your First Quarter:
 Let’s look at your first quarter (your first 3 months post
launch)...
 If the goal is $10k, those first three months might look a
 little something like this:
 Month 1: $2k
Month 2: $3k
Month 3: $5k
 Now, let’s look at...
 Your First Month:
If your goal is to bring in $2k in your first 30 days of
 launching your digital product at $97, you’d only have
 to make 20 sales!
 Are you realizing how crazy good the potential with this
 is now?! Even as a beginner, even as someone starting
 a new Instagram account?!
 And the coolest part? It’s PASSIVE income, meaning
 you could be making $$ in your sleep!
1
You can price your digital product at
 any price you wish.
 Right now I want you to think about the price you’d
 feel most comfortable selling at, as this will help you
 hit your income goals!
Also, remember to come from a place of serving your
 audience first, because that is what is going to gain
 you a LOYAL customer.
 1

For your business to thrive you need to know who your
 customer is. Why you may ask? Because it helps you
 craft a messaging strategy that appeals directly to the
 type of audience who are more likely to convert into
 customers.
 As you can probably already tell, my target audience is
 women. My branding, content and language all target
 women. Women who want to build their own
 businesses to support their family and live freely, in
 particular.
 You can either niche down to a specific type of
 audience, or broaden it. It’s really is up to you!
Here are some questions that will help you
 determine and understand your target
 audience:
 01 What age bracket are they in? E.g. 25-35
 years old
 02 Where do they live?
 03 What’s their gender?
 04 What problems/pain points do they have?
 05 Where do they get their information from?
 06 What kind of content works best for them?
 Brainstorm a list of who you see yourself easily
 identifying with and speaking to in your
 marketing.

YOUR BRANDING
Congrats if you’ve made it this far, because
 now, we’ve reached the fun stuff!
 Your branding is where you get to showcase YOU. Your personality,
 style, taste and vibe! Believe it or not though, there’s actually quite a
 bit that goes into branding because it’s SUPER POWERFUL!
 You will need to consider other things such as:
 The voice or tone of your messaging (i.e. serious, funny, casual,
 formal, optimistic, motivational etc.).
 The style of your social media and products (i.e. feminine, modern,
 minimal, luxurious, bold etc.).
 The values you communicate in your content (i.e. ambition, family,
 gratitude, success, freedom, joy etc.).
 Your brand story (i.e. your personal story or journey that will
 resonate with your target audience).
 But just to get you started first...
 Try decide these TWO things by the end of today:
 The name of your product
 Your brand aesthetic
 Naming Your Product
 When it comes to naming your product, you will want to be thinking
 about what’s going to be the clearest and simplest way to
 communicate what you’re offering to your target audience.
1
 Phrases like “passive income”, “digital product”, “DFY”
 or “done-for-you” are obviously great ones to consider
 incorporating as they draw attention!
However you also can add your own values and
 language to this, whether that might be “joy”,
 “freedom”, “wealth, “passion,” “purpose,” etc.
Here are some examples for you to brainstorm off:
 Done-For-You Digital Playbook
Path To Time-Freedom
Playbook Wealth Warrior
 Blueprint Roadmap To Passive Income
 Creating Your Brand Aesthetic
 As for your brand aesthetic, some homework for you is
 just to start collecting screenshots of other people’s
 Instagram feeds or content that best represent your
 own personal style you are wanting to achieve with
 your “forward-facing” elements of this business
 Pay attention to fonts, colors, even the layout of others’
 bios!
You may be wondering why but trust me! They will
 come in handy when you are actually setting up your
 own Instagram profile where you will be bringing in
 traffic to your digital product!
Remember, this part is supposed to be fun, so don’t
 over-think or stress out too much. You can always pivot
 or switch things up in future if you want to!

 SETTING UP YOUR BACKEND

Let’s discuss creating your digital product!
 Again, a quick reminder - you do have the rights to resell this Playbook;
 however, I want you to know how you can put your own flavor to it and make
 it your own!
 In fact, your audience is going to want to buy your product more when you
 DO make it your own, when you put your own personality and branding into
 it.
Here is what making this digital product your own can look like:
 01 Find an eBook or Document template on Canva that you like. Keep in
 mind that even with a great template you choose, you will likely need
 to move components around and play with the fonts & size to help fit
 allllllll this juicy goodness into it! Last I checked, Canva has a 100
page limit.
02 Put your Canva template aside for now, and move onto actually
 deciding what’s going to go onto your pages! For this, you can just
 pull up a new Google Doc or a Note inside your Notes app. Then
 COPY and PASTE this Playbook into it.
 03 Once you’ve copied and pasted the Playbook, carefully go through it
 page by page and highlight all of the parts, names, or photos that you
 know you will need to modify or tweak.  For example, for the
 welcome/introduction, you may want to use YOUR name, YOUR
 reasons for doing this or how YOU came across this digital product (of
 course, feel free to give me a shoutout if you’d like! You can either refer
 to me by name or IG username but this is now your product you don't
 need to mention me at all! ).
NOTE: Keep in mind that there will be things you will NOT be able to
 include and finalize until you’ve gotten further in this process of
 setting up your own back-end (i.e. your emails, your Instagram
 account, etc.).
04 Once you’ve finished modifying your document, copy and paste it
 into the Canva template you already picked out. Design it using
 the name and branding colors you came up with.
 IMPORTANT: Be sure to double-check it for any errors or
 tweaks still needing to be made!
 You can also add any hyperlinks (including affiliate links!) you
 want to include. When you download your product as a PDF from
 Canva, your links WILL still be clickable.
 05 Save the document as a PDF file and save it to your computer. When
 you get to the chapter “Setting Up Your Link In Bio” on page 28,
 follow the steps to add the PDF file to the sales process.
 06 If you’ve chosen to resell this playbook WITH resell rights to your
 customers, follow the steps in the next chapter “Reselling With
 Resell Rights”.
 Then, voilà! You’ve created your very own digital product!

There are two ways you can resell this e-book to your
 customers.
 1.
 2.
 As a PDF file (WITHOUT resell rights)
 As a PDF file AND an editable link (WITH resell rights
 for your customers) - just like I’ve sold it to you.
 PLEASE NOTE: If you wish to resell your e-book WITH
 resell rights to your own customers, you must adhere to
 the following terms:
 Change the NAME of the e-book (this is recommended
 whether or not you wish to resell this playbook with
 resell rights)
 Modify the branding of the e-book to make it your
 own
 We’ve already discussed how you would resell your
 version of this Playbook WITHOUT resell rights to
 your customers, so now, we will cover the steps
 required to resell your Playbook WITH resell rights.
 01 After you have completed modifying your digital
 product, save it as a PDF. This will be your first file
 your customer will receive.
 02 To get your OWN editable link for Canva (where
 your customers can edit your digital product for
 themselves), go to the “Share” button on the top
 right corner.
1
03 Click the “Template Link”.
 04 You will then see your designated Canva link
 which you will need to copy and add to your
 confirmation email. Alternatively you can also
 create another PDF document like I did and add
 it there as a second file.

 Additionally, the platform's customer

 Out of all of the different Link In Bio platforms or host
 sites for digital products that are out there, I definitely
 recommend using
beacons.ai the most! HANDS
 DOWN. POINT BLANK. PERIOD! You can create an
 account for FREE and get access to all the features you
 need to start selling digital products.
Because
beacons.ai really is a one- stop-shop, I
 recommend using it also for your digital product(s),
 freebies, AND emails (yes, you can do it all!).
Step 1: Go to
beacons.ai website
 The first step is to click this link to go to
beacons.ai website. Once you're on the website,
 choose your username. This can be changed later if you aren’t 100% sure.
Step 2: Choose your plan
 On the next page, you'll see a range of plans that you can choose from. Beacons.ai offers a
 free plan, as well as a variety of paid plans that offer additional features. I highly advise one
 of their paid plans that will unlock all of the features and automations you will need to
 complete the membership setup
 Step 3: Enter your email and password
 Next, you'll be asked to enter your email and choose a password. Make sure you choose a
 strong password that is difficult to guess. Click on the "Continue" button once
Step 4: Verify your email address
 After you've set up your account, you'll receive an email from beacons.ai asking you to
 verify your email address. Click on the link in the email to verify your email address.
 Now that you've created your account on beacons.ai, you're ready to start building
 your online store!
SETTING UP INSTAGRAM
Instagram is not a required social media platform for your business, but I
 DO recommend it as a great starting point (plus it’s the best platform
 everrr!).
At some point along the way, you can also utilize TikTok, Pinterest, and
 even Facebook Reels (or Facebook groups) to direct more traffic to your
 digital products (but no need to rush to use all of these platforms right
 now!).
 It’s up to you whether you want to use your existing Instagram account or
 create a new one. Either way, you will want to do these two things:
Make your account PUBLIC - so that people can find you and your business
 can actually grow!
 Make your account into a PROFESSIONAL account - Instagram offers two
 types, Business & Creator. I recommend going with Creator because it offers
 more featur
 es! You can follow the steps in
THIS LINK to get this set up.
Optimizing Your Bio
 Next you will want to start working on your bio - so that people who come your
 way will actually KNOW what you are about and how you can help them!
 let me break it down for you .
 Your Name
 Your name should have two things:
 Your name (obviously) and What you offer/specialize in
Some examples are:
 “Digital Product Coach”
 “Digital Product Seller”
 “Instagram Business Coach”
It’s important to have keywords in your name for SEO (search engine
 optimization) purposes. SEO is a process used to help get your page in front
 of people searching for your niche. Simply put, it helps your page become
 more findable.
First Line of Bio
 This is optional, however, it can be a good idea for your first line to have a
 snippet of
who you are or a little about your transformation journey (so that
 people can relate to you!).
Some examples:
 “SAHM turned 6-figure business owner”
 “Australian living that digital income dream”
 “9-5er turned digital product biz owner”
 Second Line of Bio
 Your second line can then point to
who you help and HOW you help them
 (again, this should help your target audience identify themselves and get a
 feeling of whether they’re in the right place).
Some examples:
 “Helping moms make passive income through digital products”
 “Helping women escape the rat race through digital products”
 “Helping you build that passive income lifestyle with DFY digital products”
 etc.
 Third Line of Bio
 This is completely optional however if you have any kind of  accomplishments,
 or
experience that positions you as an “authority” then you can use this line to
 showcase this.
 Some examples:
 “Made over $10k online”
“Sold 1000+ digital products”
 “Helped 300+ moms start their own digital product biz”
Fourth Line
 Your fourth line should always be a
powerful call-to-action
 ! You can direct
 them to your digital product, a free guide (freebie/lead magnet) or to your
 DM’s for a chat about what’s on offer!
 DM’s (direct messages) are a great way to build rapport with your audience.
 These short conversations can help build trust and real connection!

It’s important to note that different countries
 will have different requirements for the
 legalities of owning your own business. Please
 ensure you research this individually, as I cannot
 give legal advice. Always ask for professional
 help, should you require it.
Creating Your Terms & Conditions
 There are TWO PARAGRAPHS (the first two numbered
 points) of your Terms & Conditions you will want to
 modify for the purposes of offering Private Label
 Rights so that your customers will have the ability to
 modify and resell your guide.
You can select those two paragraphs and simply
 replace it with the following:
Paragraph 1:
 Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use,
 the Company hereby grants you Private Label Rights
 upon purchase of [insert name of your digital products
 here], which grants you the rights to modify, claim
 authorship of, and resell this product for 100% of the
 profits. Additional rights include: the right to add this
 product to a membership site or bundle within a
 package; the right to create audio or video products
 using this product; the right give away the product to
 subscribers or customers; the right to change sales
 page and/or graphics; the right to break up the
 product into separate sections; the right to add or
 remove content to the product; the right to put your
 name on it; the right to edit or create your own covers
 for the product; the right to give away, sell, or transfer
 the Private Label Rights to any third party.
Paragraph 2:
 All Content NOT included within [insert name of
 your digital products here] itself, including
 graphics, Systeme.io descriptions, and social
 media content and videos relating to the product,
 are copyrighted unless otherwise noted and are
 the property of the Company and/or a supplier to
 the Company. No such materials may be used
 except as provided in these Terms of Use.
 Then replace any blank lines in the rest of your
 Terms with your name and/or business name or
 contact information when directed.
 *After you finish, be sure to save your updates!

 SELLING YOUR DIGITAL PRODUCT

Marketing is the act of promoting your business
 and/or products. Thankfully, we live in a time where
 we DON’T have to pay to market or advertise - this is
 called organic marketing. Organic marketing is what I
 most recommend especially when first starting out.
 It’s free AND can still bring in more than enough of the
 traffic and sales you need with some great content &
 consistency.
 I recommend organic marketing through posting
 reels on Instagram (and potentially branching out to
 more social media platforms over time).
 Reels are a great way to get new eyes on your content
 and build “like, know, and trust” with potential
 customers!
 Here are some different ideas you can share
 with your target audience through Instagram
 and Facebook reels:
 01
 02
 03
 04
 05
 06
 Your WHY behind selling a DFY digital
 product (i.e. more money, more time,
 more flexibility, less stress, etc.)
Your RESULTS (i.e. income) from selling
 your DFY digital product
 What a DFY digital product is/what sets
 DFY digital products apart
 Personal stories or parts of your own journey
 that will resonate with others
 Encouragement for those who are looking
 for a way to make more money or bring in
 passive income
 Powerful thoughts or mindset shifts
 around money or business
don’t be afraid to scrol instagram for inspiration.
You may have noticed that people often model each
 other - and it’s OK to do so! Remember this If you’re ever
 out of ideas, as long as you don’t copy word-for-word!
 Instagram & Facebook Growth
 If you’re starting out a new Instagram or Facebook
 account, I recommend the following:
 Be consistent: Post 2-3 reels daily and spread them
 out morning, midday & evening (if you post more
 than this, Instagram may not push out all your
 content).
 Post at approx. same times daily: You don’t need to
 post at the exact same time, however, around the
 usual time is best.
 Use relevant consistent hashtags: It’s important to
 use the same hashtags with a new account because
 the algorithm needs time to know what you’re all
 about. If you post hashtags such as “#digitalproducts
 #selldigitalproducts” one day and then “#bossbabes
 #levelupyourlife” another day, it may take the
 algorithm a lot longer to figure out who to push your
 content to.
 *Note: It’s fine to include these hashtags in  ONE post, given they are
 RELEVANT to your reel and your niche. Just make sure you use
 them consistently for at least 4 weeks so the algorithm can learn
 who your page is for and what it is about.
 if you miss a day or two, don’t sweat it !
 Sometimes, posting daily can be tiring. When it comes
 to planning and creating content, you want to have a
 system that is actually SUSTAINABLE.
If you find that posting 2-3 x day is too much for you,
 take a step back. Breathe. Know that it is OK to have a
 break if you absolutely need to. The algorithm is not
 going to hate you. :)
If it makes it easier for you, write up a schedule that
 you know works for YOU or try batch creating your
 content.
 More on Instagram & Facebook Growth
 Here are some HOT TIPS to make your life easier:
 Take and store b-roll videos that are 5-7 seconds
 long. Add your caption and text and voilà! You have
 a reel!
 Use the FREE website called
TRELLO to jot down
 ideas and plan your content ahead.
 Save trending audios whilst scrolling through reels
 on Instagram.
 Save reels that you wish to model whilst scrolling
 through Instagram.
 Recycle content - this can be a huge time-saver!
Call-To-Action
 One thing you will want to include in the caption of the
 majority of your reels is a call-to-action, which is really
 just an invite to take the next step.
 A great call-to-action is where you tell people to DM
 you for something.
If it makes it easier for you, write up a schedule that
 you know works for YOU or try batch creating your
 content.
 For example: “DM to access my free guide on how to
 build passive income with digital products”.
A reason why DM call-to-actions are so powerful, is
 because it allows your audience to connect with
 you.
 Regardless of what call-to-action you choose to go
 with, my best recommendation is to direct them to a
 “freebie”. Once they opt in for this freebie, your
 emails will then also be able to do the selling for you!
 We’ll dive more into this in the next section.
 Some examples:
 “Free guide below ”,
“DFY digital product⬇“,
“DM “digital” for free guide”
“DM “INCOME” for more info”
“DM “passive” to learn more”

1
 You don’t need a freebie or lead magnet, however, it IS
 a good way to grow your email list.
 Email lists are a way to continually nurture your leads
 and potentially turn them into paying customers.
Freebies come in many different forms.
Some examples are:
 Free video
 Free guide or roadmap
 Free list of something related to your niche (i.e. 101
 digital product ideas)
 Free mini course
 If you need some inspo, look into what other people in
 your niche are offering as freebies by signing up to their
 email lists.
 You can create one yourself using a FREE Canva
 template, or if you want to make things even easier, The
 Ultimate Canva Template Vault has plenty of ready-made
 freebie/lead magnet templates.
 Once you have your freebie created, you can then add
 this to the top of your link in bio and start putting
 together an email flow inside systeme.io to nurture those
 new leads as well. We’re going to look at selling with your
 emails in the next section.
Freebies, Lead Magnets & Email Lists

Selling with Emails
 An email list is one of the most powerful things you
 can have for your business. It gives you a direct line of
 communication with your audience that DOESN’T rely
 on an algorithm or get as easily buried like posts on
 social media.
With a well-written email flow that goes out to this list,
 you can build trust and convert leads into customers
 with ease and automation.
 So let’s start building it!
 Setting Up Your Email
 The first thing you will want to do is be sure you have
 an email address set up with your beacons.ai account
 that you will not mind people on your email list having
 access to, if someone wants to reply to your emails.
 NOTE: Just for professionalism and privacy, I do
 recommend using a business email (NOT to be
 confused with a personal email or just a Gmail
 account). Otherwise email recipients will be able to see
 your personal email address when they are viewing the
 emails you send them.
Your Confirmation Emails
 The second thing you will want in place before setting
 up your email flow is a confirmation email containing
 the download links for each of your digital products.

FREEBIE EMAIL
 TEMPLATE
 For your convenience, I’m including templates for you below- one for your freebie, and one for your paid digital product.
Subject: You did it! Here is your free guide!

 about DFY/done-for-you digital products, as well as how you

 that message over to your primary inbox so you don't miss out
 on any updates!
 And don’t forget, you can always shoot me a DM on IG or
 message me on Facebook [include hyperlinks] anytime with
 any questions you have! I am cheering you on
 [your name here]
PAID EMAIL
 TEMPLATE
 Subject: WHOOHOO! Here is your [Product Name]!

 [DOWNLOAD LINK]
 Feel free to DM me on IG or message me on Facebook [include
 hyperlinks] when you get a chance to let me know that you've
 taken this step! I'd love to connect & celebrate with you!
 [your name here]
 Once you have set up your confirmation emails, you can then start
 setting up your email flow!
 Let’s get into it!
Don’t worry, you’re almost on the home stretch!! ;)
Setting Up Your Email Flow
 There is just one email flow, or email sequence, you
 will want to have in place when you first launch. This
 flow is for people who opt in for your freebie.
 There is no one right way to write your flow, but
 ideally your first few emails offer:
 Value
 An introduction to yourself
 Your story, and your product promotion.
 You will want to schedule your first email to be sent
 24 hours after receiving the freebie with their
 confirmation email, and then every other email to be
 sent 24 hours after the previous one.
To help you save time, I’ve included a handful of
 sample emails for you to use for yourself on the next

 Subject: Five steps to starting a DFY digital product biz
Hi [Customer Name],
 Do you want to know what I love about DFY, or done-for-you
 digital products? It’s an easy way to start up your own business
 and make money without needing to create a product from
 scratch (which, let’s be honest, is where SO many of us get
 stuck!).
THREE: Price your product. Keep in mind: A $97 product sold
 just ONCE per day is almost $3k a month!
 And while there ARE business models such as MLMs and
 affiliate marketing that are already meeting this need, there
 are none that offer quite as much ownership, or freedom from
 attachment to another brand, as DFY.
ONE: Find a DFY product with Private Label Rights. (Don’t
 worry, I’ve actually already created the PERFECT one [include
 hyperlink] for you!)
Here are five steps to starting a DFY digital product biz in the
 next 30 days:
 TWO: Make it your own! Add your own branding or your own
 voice. Take into account who you want your target audience to
 be as you are modifying or rewriting.
 When you have a DFY product with resell rights, your profits are
 YOUR profits, and your business is YOUR business.

 FOUR: Put systems in place to drive traffic to your store. This
 can look like using organic marketing on social media (think:
 reels on IG, pins on Pinterest, etc.). This can also look like you
 promoting a freebie, or lead magnet, to grow your email list
 where you can then nurture ideal customers and bring in sales
 daily.
 FIVE: Start bringing in passive income! Actually get to LIVE your
 life while watching money come in, just from someone
 stumbling across a seven-second reel or reading an automated
 email.
 Listen - if you are tired of trading all of your time for money or
 struggling under the weight of financial stress, I get it! I have
 been there, and there is a better way.
 The power of digital products is being able to have a stream of
 income that frees you from that stress and allows you to create
 more time for the people and things you love.
 And I’ve created the perfect product for you to do this with!
 My [Product Name - include hyperlink] walks you through a 30
day step-by-step process of setting up and selling your own
 digital products using my DFY template (resell rights included!).
[YOUR NAME HERE]
 Why? Because I believe deep in my heart that there is more
 than enough to go around.
 If you are ready to get started and launch your own passive
 income biz in the next 30 days, your next step is to purchase
 the [Product Name - include hyperlink].
 When you follow the steps inside, you will not only come out on
 the other side with a product ready to sell, but you will also
 have an actual funnel and strategy for bringing in the sales!
 I want you to use everything inside [Product Name], including
 [Product Name] itself, to really create a passive income business
 that you can fully make your own AND fully profit from.

 P.S. Don’t forget, you can always shoot me a DM [insert
 hyperlink] on Instagram or Facebook with any questions you
 have. I am here for you!
 NOTE: Later on down the road, you may want to have a second email flow, specifically for people who
 purchase your digital products. This is primarily if you are also offering other products that you want to sell
 as add-ons!

We’ve touched on building connection with your reels, as well as
 with your emails, but I also want to offer a few more ideas on how
 you can help leads get to know you and your product!
 Building Connections: DMs
 One of the best parts of using Instagram or Facebook (or both!) as your
 marketing platform is how easy it is to build a sense of community and
 relationship. The DMs, or direct messaging system built into the app, is a
 perfect tool to use for this!
 When you launch your freebie & digital product, one thing you can have in
 place is a short series of DMs you send to people who reach out for your links.
 You will want to be sure that these DMs you send are designed to SERVE
 and not just sell. Remember that these are real human beings you are
 talking to, not just a means to an end!
 To help you brainstorm some ideas, here are some sample DMs you might
 want to incorporate into your follow-up strategy:
 Hey ____, I’m so glad you’re here! I’d love to know more about you and
 help in any way I can. Did anything from my [insert freebie here] resonate
 with you?
 Hey ____! I just wanted to check in and see if there is anything I can do for
 you!
 Hey _____, I just wanted to check in! Was my [insert freebie here] helpful,
 or are there any questions I can help answer?
Building Connections: Stories
 Posting to your Instagram Stories is one piece of your
 marketing strategy you do not want to gloss over!
 Even if you aren’t sharing new things to your Stories
 everyday, just popping in every couple of days with an
 update on your sales, or screenshots of messages
 coming in, or even just a peek into your everyday life
 is a great way to help build connection with your
 audience.
 If you aren’t too sure of what to share or how to layout
 your Stories, start observing the Stories of other
 business owners on Instagram to see how they are
 utilizing theirs. And of course, feel free to check out
 mine for inspiration as well!
 Once you start posting Stories that can be helpful for
 your audience, you will want to create some Highlights
 for your profile.
 Some Highlight ideas include:
 Your results
 Your story/your why
FAQ
Info about your freebie
Info about your digital product

 LAUNCHING YOUR DIGITAL PRODUCT

YAY! You’ve made it to the launching
 section, which means IT’S GO TIME!
Once you’ve confirmed that your products, your Link In Bio, your email flows,
 and your Instagram and Facebook are all functioning and set up correctly, you
 will want to officially launch your product and start promoting it.
 Here are some fun things you can do to boost sales with your launch:
Do a short PRE-LAUNCH where you start hinting on your Instagram that
 something new and awesome is coming. Create a countdown. Invite
 people to DM you for that freebie if it’s already ready. Stir up hype!
 Offer a launch promo or special “launch pricing.” You can offer this to
 your audience for a week or so and promote it on both IG and in your
 freebie emails. Just remember to go back through those emails after the
 launch promo ends to take out the sections where you are mentioning it!)
 Create hype in your Stories and posts! Take screenshots of new sales or
 give updates on what’s happening throughout the launch (and of course,
 you can KEEP doing this even AFTER the launch ends as well!)
 Don’t forget to push your freebie! Even if people aren’t ready to buy now,
 you can still get them on your email list by offering your freebie and
 nurture them until they’re ready to buy over time.
Share what you are doing on your other social media platforms,
 and remember to stay consistent.
The more you practice and put out your content
 the better you will get and the more you will
 learn what works for you! Engage with other
 people in the digital marketing niche to make
 friends in this space and also increase
 engagement on your own account.
Lastly, HAVE FUN! Be yourself. Be
 authentic. Be BOLD. And plan to celebrate
 in some way, no matter what!
 Thanks for downloading this freebie, I hope
 this helps get you started and I would love to
 help you on this journey. Feel free to reach
 out on IG @digital_chicken_mama!
 I am SO excited for you!
We all can win!
You got this!
